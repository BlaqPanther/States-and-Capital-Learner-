# States-and-Capital-Learner-
This is a US states and capital Learner 

This project would be an interactive map that helps the user learn/quiz themselves on their knowledge of where the 50 states are located and which capital belongs to each state. As a result, there would be 2 modes, one that tests the states and one that tests the capitals. More specifically, the program would provide a state/capital and the user would click on a generated map where they believe it to be located. The program would then let the user know whether or not it was correct. If incorrect, the program would let them know which state/capital they clicked and prompt them to try again. 

KEY FEATURES:
Feature 1: The first feature involves drawing the actual map of the US. The US map would also have an outline of all the states and a star at the location of their capital.
Feature 2: The second feature involves interacting with the map itself. More specifically, the program takes mouse clicks that correspond with the different states. 
Feature 3: The third feature verifies whether the userâ€™s click was correct. If the correct state was clicked, the program will give the user a message that it is correct. If incorrect, the program will highlight where the state actually is. In the end, the program will tell the user how many of the 50 they got right and which states they specifically got incorrect.
